# Different Aspects Of Git And GitHub
### Git
**Git** is a distributed version control system allowing us to have control over all the previous versiobs of our files as well as allowing easy collaboration and community tasks.

### GitHub
**Github** is a hosting service for all our open-source projects allowing us the full implementation of git.

### Git Workflow
1. _Workspace_ - Main Directory
2. _Index_ or _Staging Area_
3. _Local Repository_
4. _Remote Repository_

### Different Stages Ig Git project
1. *Untracked* - File exists but is not pushed to VCS.
2. *Staged* - File has been added to git but hasn't been yet committed.
3. *Committed* - Change has been committed.

### Forking
If we want to work on someone else's project or use their project as a starting point, we **fork** it

### Cloning
After forking, project still remains on **GitHub**. so in order to get it on our computer/workspace, we **clone** it.

### Branching
**Branching** is used so that multiple people collaborate on a single project without affecting the main project and also in handling different parts of a single project simultaneously.

### Pull Request
It is used whenever we want to merge our changes or contributions with the original project. A heading and a proper description is added so that the project supervisor understands what the changes are and why it should be incorporated to the project. Once the project supervisor accepts the **PR** and confirms merge, our files are merge with the condition of having no merge conflicts.

### Merging 
Whenever we want to merge two branches we use: git merge branchname where, branchname is the branch which gets merged to the branch where we currently are.

### Merge Conflict
A **merge conflict **is an event which occurs when there are conflicting changes on the same lines, so git cannot know which changes to keep and which to discard. So merge conflict demands the problem to be manually solved. The error message directs us to the lines where conflicting code is present.

### Creating An Issue
If we want to __report__ an issue in an **open-source** project we can do it by raising an issue and this way the issue will be opened in the **open-source** community.
