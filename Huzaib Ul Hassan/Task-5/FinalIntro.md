# Final Introduction
_Hello there!_
My name is **Huzaib**. Thanks for taking time to know about me.
I am currently a first year student at __Indian Institute Of Technology, Roorkee.__
Although, I am currently pursuing B.Tech in ~Civil Engineering~ but I hardly have any interests in the field. :wink:
I have explored the field of Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep learning the past six months and I am hopeful to make a career in this particular field only.
My first internship was with an EdTech startup named **MissionEd**. I worked mostly as a *Python developer* and _Data Science intern_. Then I started and am still working with another startup called **Chai Sutta Bar** again as a ~Data Analyst~. Also, I recently got selected as an intern for another startup called **MyriadCara** as an __AI Development Intern__. I know a lot of startups, right? But what can I do, I'm afresher and nobody provides opportunities to freshers. Also, all these internships were unpaid. :bow:  Looking forward to gain experience in the open-source domain.
